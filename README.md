This repository contains a program that 
calculates a user’s total holiday cost, which includes the plane cost(airplane cost for the city of their choice) , hotel cost(hotel price per night and number of nights they'd be staying) , and car rental cost(rental price per day and number of days the car would be rented out)..

All these factors are added together to give the total holiday cost.
